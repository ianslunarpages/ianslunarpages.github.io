While rummaging around in the attic (metaphorically speaking) to find the ideas for this page, I came across a whole
 load of related stuff. This page seemed big enough already, so I put it all on a page named <a href="jack.html"> 
"Jack"</a><br><br><a name="1">Set was the evil uncle of the Egyptian god Horus, who had murdered and dismembered 
Horus's father, Osiris, on Midsummer's Day, and molested Horus as a child. Set had the head of an unknown animal, 
which was sometimes an ass (connecting him to Bottom in "A Midsummer Nights Dream", 
Typhon, <a href = "gisbourne.html"> Guy of Gisbourne</a>, Ishmael<a href="#*">*</a>, King Midas - who was given ass's 
ears by Apollo, and later deified and represented as an ass - and many other mythical characters), and sometimes a 
strange creature with a long snout, squared off upright ears, slim body and long legs (<a href="setpic.html">picture</a>), 
which has been described as an aardvark, a wild pig, a composite of several creatures, something unknown to science or an 
okapi. <br><br><a name="2">Set may not originally have been seen as an evil god, possibly the cult of Set was overthrown
 by the worshippers of Horus, who defaced his statues, re-wrote the legends and maybe exterminated the unfortunate animal
 sacred to him<a href="#**">**</a>. It has been suggested that the Christian image of Satan may have been partly modelled 
on Set. Set also seems to have popped up in modern popular culture as <a href="batman.html"> Batman</a> <br><br>

The theory that Set's animal was a composite of many different animals is 

supported by the fact that several animals were at various times associated with him:<br>
In one legend, Set appears as a black pig (click <a href= "wadjet.html#legend"> here </a> for more on this). 
In another legend, he takes the form of a bull hippopotamus, (female hippopotami and pigs were generally considered more benevolent) and the association of Set with the hippopotamus was widespread during the Old kingdom (2649-2134 B.C.). Set became associated with the donkey sometime  in the Middle kingdom (2040-1991 B.C.) and by the New kingdom (1550-1070 B.C.), an unpopular person could be cursed as follows:<br><i>"May a donkey violate him, may a donkey violate his wife, may he not bequeath his [official] post to his children".</i><br>The <a href="equines.html">Oryx</a>, a desert dwelling antelope, was originally associated with the gods Sokar and Ra, but by the end of the New kingdom it was associated with Set <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[4]</a>.I am not really convinced by the "composite animal" theory, as most of the other Egyptian deities were represented by real animals, and a specimen of the appropriate animal would be kept in the temple of that deity. (the Egyptians did believe in a demon which was part lion and part crocodile, dwelling in the underworld, and eating the hearts of sinners, but I don't think that this
 really counts). I have noticed that many of the ancient Egyptian illustrations of pigs do vaguely resemble Set's animal, 
at least as far as the head is concerned. <a href="#top">[Top]</a><br><br><a name="donkeys">
<h2>Donkeys</h2>

<b>THE DONKEY</b>
 G.K. Chesterton<p>

When fishes flew and forests walked <br>
And figs grew upon thorn, <br>
Some moment when the moon was blood <br>
Then surely I was born; <p><p>

With monstrous head and sickening cry <br>
And ears like errant wings, <br>
The devil's walking parody <br>
On all four-footed things. <p><p>

The tattered outlaw of the earth, <br>
Of ancient crooked will; <br>
Starve, scourge, deride me: I am dumb, <br>
I keep my secret still. <p><p>

Fools! For I also had my hour; <br>
One far fierce hour and sweet: <br>
There was a shout about my ears, <br>
And palms before my feet.<p> <p>

  

 Donkeys were first domesticated in the Nile valley, probably in pre-dynastic times (5500-2920 B.C.), and later introduced to Asia. Fans of Winnie the Pooh may be interested to know that the Egyptian name for the donkey was Eeyor <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[6]</a>. They may have been domesticated independently in Neolithic Spain. Donkeys were first employed to pull the plough and to thresh the corn (perhaps this was why Set was held responsible for the murder of Osiris, who represented - among other things - the ripening corn).<br><br>White asses were especially prized in Egypt. I don't know if this tradition predates the character assasination of Set. As is well known, Cleopatra used to bathe in asses milk, as did Poppaea, a wife of Nero. Asses milk was believed to give a white complexion, and said to have numerous medicinal properties. Modern research has shown that asses' milk closely resembles human milk, and may be preferable to cow's milk in this respect. Until recently, it was believed to help cure meningitis. Poppaea is said to have kept 500 she-asses, and this is not unreasonable, as the milk yield is small <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[3]</a>.<br><br> Roman married couples used to adorn their beds with carved asses' heads, because of the association of the ass with fertility. The asses' head, representing Typhon was also engraved onto leaden tablets which were used as curses to cause accidents to rivals in Greek and Roman races. The Romans held the ass sacred to the Goddess Vesta. This was probably because of the association with flour and corn (see section on Samson below). There is even a graffito from third century Rome showing an ass-headed figure hanging on a cross, with an inscription on it reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexamenos_graffito">"Alaxemenos worships god"</a>  It has been interpreted as an insult to the Christian religion (Jews and early Christians were sometimes accused of worshipping a god who was a donkey), although it has also been suggested that it represents Typhon/Set and is not intended to be derogatory.<br> According to Epiphaneus (Heresy XXVI.12), The gnostics had a book which they called "The Birth (or descent) of Mary" which stated that Zacharius, the father of John the baptist, was killed because <i>"....he saw as he was burning incense, a man standing there who had the form of an ass. And when he went out, they say and would have said: woe unto you! what (or whom) do you worship? He that was seen of him within the temple shut his mouth, that he might not be able to speak. And when his mouth was opened, so that he could speak, then he revealed it to them  and they slew him."</i><br><a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[9]</a> <br>
In <i>Claudius the God</i> by Robert Graves, Herod Agrippa dissuades Calligula from placing his statue in the temle of Jerusalem with the following story:
<i>Are you aware of the nature of the statue which is now ket in the innermost shrine of the Temple, and the rites wich are performed about it on holy days? ....the god of the Jews is an extraordinary fellow. He has been described as an anti-God. He has a rooted aversion to statues, particularly to statues of majestic bearing and dignified workmanship like those of the Greek Gods. In order to symbolise his hatred for other divinities he has ordered the erection, in this inner shrine, of a large crude, and ludicrous statue of an Ass. It has long ears, huge teeth, and enormous genitals, and on every holy day the priests abuse this statue with the vilest incantations and bespatter it with the most loathsome excrement and offal and then wheel it on a carriage around the inner court for the whole congregation to abuse similarly; so that the whole Temple stinks like the Great Sewer. It is a secret ceremony. No non Jews are admitted to it and the Jews themselves are not allowed to speak about it under penalty of a curse. In any case I am risking it for your sake."</i> <br><br>


Donkeys are quite intelligent animals, the association with foolishness seems to have originated in Italy, possibly in the late Roman era. Prior to that time, as I have shown, many people held Donkeys in high esteem. In 260 B.C. There was a consul named Gnaius Cornelius Scipio Asina, who is believed to have been so called because of his large ears <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[3]</a>. The clan names Asina and Asellus were particularly distinguished at this time <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[1]</a>.<br><br>The childish insult of touching ones ears with the thumbs, and waving the open palms of the hands at someone (you know what I mean), probably represents  the ears of a donkey. Plutarch (book V, 363) reports that the Egyptians once called the Persian ruler Ochus, an ass. He responded by killing and eating the sacred <a href= "bees.html"> Apis </a> bull <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[6]</a>.<br><br><a name="3">

There also seems to be a connection between the Donkey and the 

European tradition of appointing a "Lord of Misrule" or "Christmas fool" 

at Midwinter. This tradition echoes the Roman tradition of the Midwinter Saturnalia, when slaves and masters changed places. 
In <i>The Quest of the holy grail</i> Hector has a dream in which Lancelot is wreathed in holly and riding a 
donkey<a href="#***">***</a><a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[13]</a>. The location for Castle Cawdor near Inverness 
(made famous in <i>Macbeth</i>), was apparently chosen because the first Thane of Cawdor, William Calder had a dream that
 the castle should be built where his donkey lay down to rest. The donkey lay down next to a holly tree, the remains of 
which can still be seen in the castle grounds. In the Celtic tree calendar, the Beth Luis Nionn, holly represents the month immediately following the summer solstice, and oak the month preceding it <a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[1]</a>.<br><br> It should also be remembered that Christ, like Dionysus, 
rode a donkey, and that the cross shaped patch of dark hair on a donkey's back (which distinguishes true donkeys, from 
<a href="equines.html">onagers</a>) is said to commemorate this event. 
<br><br>
<br>The zodiacal sign of Cancer (which the sun enters on midsummers day) was, at one time represented as two donkeys feeding at a manger (the <a href= "bees.html"> beehive </a> cluster)
<a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[2]</a> Edward Topsell<a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[14]</a> writes of asses:<br> <i>"They are not coupled in the spring aequinoctium like mares and other beasts, but in the summer solstice by reason of their cold natures"</i><br> Topsell quotes Pliny and Aristotle as his sources.  <br><br>

[postscript] Since writing most of this page a donkey entered my life. Her name was Margarita 
 (or Maggie for short), a pun on the Bulgarian word "Magaritsa" meaning a female donkey. You can see a picture
 of her and (shock horror!) me <a href="ianandmaggie.html">here</a>. She helped me with farm work. She was intelligent,
 affectionate and devious. Working with her was rather like negotiating with a trade union :-) 
 Maggie answered a few of the questions I had about donkey folklore and raised a few new ones: 

Her reproductive cycle certainly seemed to be synchronised with solar and lunar cycles. 
 Maggie was most noticably in heat at the midwinter full moon, backing up Topsell's claims. 
 During the summer months she stopped going into heat, and started again in late August but this time precisely 
 at new moon. Once in the spring I saw her stop and gaze at the rising full moon in an almost trance like state.
 She unexpectedly went into heat on July 22nd 2009, the day of a solar eclipse

Maggie was very fond of eating oak leaves. Some websites state that oak is poisonous to horses and donkeys,
 others say that acorns are poisonous to horses, and some say that oak leaves are a kind of donkey narcotic
 (which I can certainly believe. Maggie also liked eating fermenting fruit, I can certainly believe that she 
 is drunk and stoned much of the time!). The oak leaves don't seem to do her any harm, and she seems smart 
 enough to know what is good for her (donkeys have a significantly different diet from horses, eating more weeds
 - notably thistles, bark, tree leaves and buds, and generally enjoying coarser and poorer quality food than horses. 
 They are very cheap to feed and maintain). There are no holly trees locally, so I don't know how she would have reacted
 to
 them, but she seemed capable of eating lots of spiny and unpalatable plants. Maggie lived with me for donkey's years 
 she died early in 2023. I miss her company. <br><br>

With regard to the story of Samson (see below) it may be relevant that Maggie was distincly shaggy haired, with a 
 pronounced fringe in summer, and moulted considerably around midsummer. In  "The Frogs" by Aristophanes, Charon, 
 ferrymen of the underworld, makes a reference to "The ass clippings", a place where those hoary with sin would be 
 shorn clean<a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[1]</a>
The missing piece of the puzzle here is the onager or wild ass <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onager">onager</a>. These animals are a different species from the African wild ass 
 which was domesticated into the familiar donkey. The Onager is larger, stronger and worse tempered than the African ass. 
 It was also domesticated in ancient times to pull chariots, along with hybrids with the african ass, but the domestication was abandoned, 
 and nowadays it survives as a rare wild species in parts of the middle east
 and central asia. The Syrian subspecies of onager which is the "wild ass" of the bible is now completely extinct.
 There was a peculiar tradition of ritual ass burials in the middle east, especially the levant. 
 The donkeys appear to have been sacrificed. This <a href="Equid_Burials_in_Archaeological_Contexts">paper</a> provides a good overview.

 <a name="Samson"><h3>Samson</h3><br><h4>lion and donkey</h4><a href="aspic.html"> (Click here for picture) </a><br><br>
As well as threshing the corn, donkeys were also sometimes blindfolded or blinded, so that they could be induced to walk 
in a circle and turn a mill wheel. This is of course what the Philistines did to Samson, in revenge for his killing of 
10,000 of them with the jawbone of an ass. Earlier in the story, Samson had asked the Philistines a riddle: 
<br><i>"Out of the eater came forth meat, out of the strong something good to eat"</i><br> Samson was talking about the 
honey from the wild <a href="bees.html">bees</a> which he had found nesting inside the ribcage of a young lion which 
  he had 
slain previously. The Philistines reply to him with another riddle:<br> <i>"What is stronger than a lion? and what is 
sweeter than honey?"</i><br> The answer to <i>this</i> riddle is of course love, and Samson, with his mane of dreadlocks 
is the lion who is to be overcome. A psychological interpretation of this story can be found <a href="psycho.html">
here</a>.<br><br> Samson is therefore compared to a lion in the first part of the story, and an ass in the second
<a href="#****">****</a>. <br><br>There is an interesting carved stone in Montrose museum, telling this story. 
Click <a href="pictish.html">here </a> for a photo.<br><br>
Rather worryingly, the <a href="http://www.sevenseals.com/sweetness.html"> Branch Davidians </a> seem to agree with 
me on some of this!<br><br> <a name="5">Usually in stories of this type (Osiris, and Set, Llew Llaw and Goronwy, 
Curoi and Cuchullain, Baldur and Hodur<a href="#*****">*****</a> etc.), the hero's bizarre secret weakness allows him to
 be killed by his rival who takes his place. Often the rival is the  lover of the hero's wife. Samson is an exception, he 
has no rival, Delilah has no other lover, and after his secret weakness has been revealed, he is not killed. It is as 
though Osiris has become Set. Perhaps this is because the story of Samson comes from a strictly monotheistic  society. 
<br><br>
The lion-headed man seems to be a very ancient image. There is a 32000 year old carving from Hohlenstein-Stadel in 
Germany, made from Mammoth Ivory, apparently showing a figure with the head of a lion. Some experts claim that it is a 
woman with the head of a lioness (most statues from this era of women). It looks pretty macho to me. Click <a href="lionhead.html">
here</a> to see a picture.<br><br>



I think there is a parallel here with the story of <a href="gisbourne.html">Robin Hood and Guy of Gisbourne</a>, in which 

Robin would have been killed by Guy were it not for divine intervention by the <a href="The_White_Goddess.html">
The White Goddess</a>, but instead Robin kills Guy and dresses in Guy's grotesque horse (or should that be donkey?) 
hide cloak, so that it appears as though Guy has killed Robin.<br><br>In 
<i>The Last Battle</i> by C.S.Lewis, a donkey impersonates Aslan by dressing up in a lion skin. 
I wonder where Lewis got his ideas from. It seems strange to me that an evangelical Christian should be using  
pagan motifs in his novels, although he does seem to be reinterpreting them in his own way. Looking at "The Lion the
 Witch and the Wardrobe" in this light, Aslan is not only Jesus, but also the new sun ushering in the Spring, and
 triumphing over <a href = "The_White_Goddess.html"> The White Goddess</a>. If the lion is considered to be the king of beasts, then the donkey  must be the slave: The most maltreated of all domestic animals, and one of the cheapest to maintain. The lion is a solar symbol, whereas the donkey would seem to be a symbol of saturn. Saturn is the most distant planet known in ancient times which symbolically turns the corn mill of the sky. Saturn is often portrayed as a fool, miller or reaper. In alchemy the sun is associated with gold and Saturn with lead. The donkey is a symbol of lust, and also (especially in Christian iconography) as a symbol of humility. I think it may be significant that 
<a href="elf.html">elves</a> seem to have been portrayed with ass ears and dreadlocks<br><br> The Ethiopian emperor, 
Haille Selassie had the title of "Conquering lion of the tribe of Judah", and for centuries before him, 

Ethiopian emperors used a seal with the inscription <i>"The lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed"</i>,
 taken from Revelations 5.5. Rastafarians, who worship Haille Selassie as a god, compare dreadlocks to a lions mane, and 
trace the tradition of dreadlocks back to Samson. Rastafarianism seems to have been founded in 1932, by Leonard Percival Howell, a couple of years after the coronation of Haille Selassie. It seems to be inspired by Christianity and Judaism, as well as traditional African religions. The Wolof society of Senegal and Gambia; Tyedde, the Islamic Baye Faal sect; the Okomfo Akan fetish priests of Ghana and many other traditional healers of West Africa all wear dreadlocks<a href="Bibliography2.html#Set">[15]</a> <a href="#top">[Top]</a><br><br>More on these kind of subjects can be found on the page called <a href="jack.html">Jack</a><br><br><center><img src="MINIMOON.GIF" align="center" border="0" width="70" height="70"></center><br><br><a name="*">*Ishmael, Isaac's half-brother was "like unto a wild ass</a> among men".

Jacob had his vision of the <a href= "Stairway.html"> Stairway to heaven </a> after cheating Esau out of his birthright. Amongst other things, the story seems to be about the Neolithic revolution:  Jacob the farmer, supplants Esau, the hunter.

executes Hodur, despite apparently knowing that Loki was responsible.
